/*
    The mean calculated for vmin comes out to be around 0.037, so it should be option (b). Learnt that use of C++11 random library is slower than regular rand and srand methods ðŸ¤”

    We know that out sample error has to be close to in sample error as per Hoeffding's inequality. v1_avg and vrand_avg closely follow the out sample probability as they both come out to be close to 0.5.
    However the coin cmin, does not follow the out sample probability as closely.
