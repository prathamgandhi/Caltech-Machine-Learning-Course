# Caltech-Machine-Learning-Course

This repository will contain all the solutions to homework problems given in the Caltech Machine Learning course.
The solutions will be strictly the ones that are written by me and are for my future references, however anyone is free to check it out if they feel it would be helpful to them.
There is no guarantee that the solutions are definitely correct and if found wrong feel free to raise an issue, I would love to discuss it.
